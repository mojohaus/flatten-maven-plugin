    <section name="Flatten Maven Plugin">
      <p>The Flatten Maven Plugin generates a flattened version of the pom.xml that Maven installs
        and deploys instead of the original. The flattened POM has the following characteristics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Build specific elements are removed</li>
        <li>Development specific elements are removed by default</li>
        <li>It only contains elements required for users of your artifact</li>
        <li>Its variables are resolved</li>
        <li>Its parent relationship is resolved, flattened and removed</li>
        <li>Its build time driven profiles <b>can</b> be evaluated so their impact gets embedded</li>
        <li>JDK or OS driven profiles still remain allowing dynamic dependencies if needed</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For a complete specification of how the flattened POM is built see <a href="flatten-mojo.html">here</a>.
        This allows the following possibilities and features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You can keep the versions of parent POMs fixed and use them for development only distributed
        via version control only instead of maven repositories. This way you can use centralized
        variables and dependencyManagement without maintaining and releasing parent POM versions.</li>
        <li>You can use a lot of the flexibility of maven but avoid various mistakes resulting in
        installing or deploying inconsistent POMs.</li>
      </ul>      
      <subsection name="Goals">
      <ul>
        <li><a href="flatten-mojo.html">flatten:flatten</a> generates the flattened POM and sets it as file of the maven project.</li>
        <li><a href="clean-mojo.html">flatten:clean</a> removes any files created by <code>flatten:flatten</code>.</li>
      </ul>
